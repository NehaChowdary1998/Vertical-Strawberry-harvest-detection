# Project Title 
Vertical-Strawberry-harvest-detection

## Overview
Developed a novel deep-learning-based vision system to detect and localise complex, occluded strawberry clusters in real  time, supporting autonomous robotic harvesting by integrating state-of-the-art perception, manipulation, and control modules  to enable efficient, damage-free fruit collection. <img width="479" height="282" alt="thumbnail_image001" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/decc302f-7470-4a3e-ad00-1fa06a80b25c" />

## Dataset
Atleast 300 Strawberry cluster images were collected from Tiptree farm UK where collected in JPG format <img width="1168" height="657" alt="thumbnail_image005" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ff46a0-e143-45c3-9768-3e8adbdd7e0d" />

## Approach
Step-by-step description (data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation).
- The data collected from the farm was annotated using Roboflow Segmentation method  


## Tools & Technologies
Roboflow segment annotation, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, YOLOv11, 

## Results
- Accuracy, F1-score, mAP, etc.
- Business impact metrics (time saved, accuracy improved, cost reduced).
- Include plots, confusion matrices, or visual samples.

• Implemented stem classification techniques that enhanced cutting precision by 50% in manufacturing processes.  
• Recommended efficient approach trajectories and difficulty levels, improving berry occlusion access by 70% using Roboflow's 
segmentation technique.  
• Developed and optimized YOLOv11 Segmentation model, achieving 85% accuracy in real-time detection of ripe strawberries 
across diverse canopy structures.  
• Experimented on vertical farming systems at Wilkins and Son's Tiptree farms, UK, achieving 75% accuracy in crop yield 
predictions.
