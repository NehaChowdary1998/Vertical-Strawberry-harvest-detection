# Vertical-Strawberry-harvest-detection
Developed a novel deep-learning-based vision system to detect and localise complex, occluded strawberry clusters in real  time, supporting autonomous robotic harvesting by integrating state-of-the-art perception, manipulation, and control modules  to enable efficient, damage-free fruit collection.
